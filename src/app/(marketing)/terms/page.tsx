            These Terms govern your access to and use of DAO Sentinel (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). By
            using the Service you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>1. The Service</h2>
          <p>
            DAO Sentinel is an independent governance-analytics platform. We aggregate public
            on-chain and Snapshot/Tally data and present metrics, scores, alerts, and AI-generated
            summaries. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or acting on behalf of any DAO,
            protocol, or token issuer we track.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Not financial or voting advice</h2>
          <p>
            All content — including Democracy Scores, whale alerts, delegate analytics, and AI
            summaries — is provided for informational purposes only. It is <strong>not</strong>{' '}
            financial, investment, legal, or voting advice. AI summaries may contain errors; always
            verify against the original proposal before acting. You are solely responsible for your
            decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
          <p>
            You must provide a valid email to create an account and are responsible for activity
            under it. Keep access to your email secure, since login uses magic links. You must be at
            least 16 years old.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not scrape, overload, or attempt to disrupt the Service or its APIs.</li>
            <li>Do not exceed the rate limits of your plan or share API keys.</li>
            <li>Do not use the Service to break any law or infringe others&rsquo; rights.</li>
            <li>Do not resell or redistribute the data feed without a written agreement.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. A free public good</h2>
          <p>
            DAO Sentinel is provided free of charge as public-goods infrastructure. There are no
            paid plans, subscriptions, or fees, and we do not sell your data. The service is funded
            by ecosystem and public-goods grants. We may introduce optional supporter tiers in the
            future, but the core watchdog product will remain free for everyone.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            The Service&rsquo;s software, design, and original content are ours or our
            licensors&rsquo;. Underlying blockchain and governance data is public and not owned by
            us. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Service per
            these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Availability &amp; changes</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis.
            Data may be delayed, incomplete, or inaccurate due to upstream sources. We may modify,
            suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclaimer &amp; limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied.
            We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or for losses
            arising from your reliance on the Service, governance decisions, or trading activity.
            Because the Service is provided free of charge, our aggregate liability for any claim is
            limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms. You may stop using
            the Service and delete your account at any time.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Governing law &amp; changes to terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms; material changes take effect on the &ldquo;Last
            updated&rdquo; date above, and continued use constitutes acceptance. Any disputes will
            be handled under the laws of our place of establishment, without regard to
            conflict-of-law rules.
          </p>
